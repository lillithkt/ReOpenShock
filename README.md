# ReOpenShock

Shocks you when you die in R.E.P.O!

## Downloading

I havent put this on thunderstore yet, so you will need to install it locally!

Downloads can be found [Here](https://github.com/lillithkt/ReOpenShock/actions/workflows/build.yml) if you are logged in to github, or [Here](https://nightly.link/lillithkt/ReOpenShock/workflows/build/main/ReOpenShock.dll.zip) if you are not.

## Installing


You will need to set your API key in `BepInEx/config/gay.lilyy.ReOpenShock.cfg`
You will also need to set your API host if you are not using openshock.app
